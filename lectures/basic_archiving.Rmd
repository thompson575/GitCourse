# Homemade Code Archive

### Working Folder  

read_data.R  
explore_data.R  
fit_glms.R


### Archive  

read_data_2023_01_20.R  
explore_data_2023_01_20.R  
explore_data_2023_01_24.R  
fit_glms_2023_01_24.R

# Pros and Cons of a Homemade Archive

### Benefits

- One active copy of each file (no confusion over which to run)   
- Dated (able to reproduce/approximate earlier analyses)  
- Perhaps, it fulfils 80% of your needs

### Limitations

- Restoring to an earlier date has to be done manually and is not exact   
- Not clear what changed between versions or why they were archived    
- Difficult to work on two developments at the same time
- Not designed for sharing/collaboration  
  - who made what changes  
  - who has overall control  
  - possible conflicts if two people modify the same current script  
- This archiving system is not widely used    
- This archiving system is not integrated into RStudio or VSCode

# Professional Archiving of Code

<br>

- **Git** and **subversion (SVN)** are both free and create similar, but not compatible, code archives

- **Git** is the most widely used  

- **Git** was written by software developers for software developers  

- the terminology of **Git** can be off-putting for data scientists  

- **Git** is designed for version control of code. It is not suitable for archiving data  

- you make a separate **Git** archive for each project  

- **Git** can create local archives (on your computer) or remote archive (on a shared drive or in the cloud)

# Git Terminology  

<br>

Git term   |   meaning  
------------------|--------------------------------  
**repository**   (repo) | an archive  
**local**             | on your computer  
**remote**            | not on your computer e.g. in the cloud  
**to stage**          | to mark a file for inclusion in the next commit    
**to commit**         | to save/update the files in an archive  
**.gitignore**         | text file listing file types that Git will ignore when committing  

<br>
<br>

A local Git repo is just a (hidden) folder called **.git** within your project folder. **Do not play with the contents!!**

# Main Branch

Soon you will have a chain of commits called the main (master) branch

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph dot {

graph [layout = dot,
       rankdir = LR]

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 1']
a

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 2']
b

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 3']
c


edge [color = black]
a -> {b}
b -> {c}
}")
```


---
# Extra Branches

Most local repos only have one branch  

You could go back to commit 2 and work on an alternative version of the code. This would create a second branch.  

Separate branches are most useful when two people collaborate  

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph dot {

graph [layout = dot,
       rankdir = LR]

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 1']
a

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 2']
b

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 3']
c

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 4']
d

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Commit 5']
e

node [shape = square,
      style = filled,
      color = cyan,
      label = 'Merge']
f

edge [color = black]
a -> {b}
b -> {c d}
d -> {e}
c -> {f}
e -> {f}
}", height=200)
```

# More Git Terminology

<br>

Git term   |   meaning  
------------------|--------------------------------
**branch**  | a chain of commits  
**main branch**             | the original chain       
**merge**   | combine two branches

# Git Interfaces

* Via a **terminal** using linux style commands  
  - `git commit -m "Newcastle presentation"`  
  - does everything but not easy to learn   
<br>
* Via a Git **client**  
  - graphical interface .. click and drag  
  - https://Git-scm.com/download/gui/windows   
  - many are free   
<br>
* Via **RStudio**  
  - Git tab - very basic Git client  
  - terminal tab - for more advanced tasks

# Web-based Archives

<br>

- **GitHub**, **bitbucket**, **GitLab**, **sourceforge** and others, offer cloud-based hosting of **Git** archives  

- **GitHub** is the most widely used  

- **GitHub** is often used to mirror a local **Git** archive  

- **GitHub** is ideal for collaboration and dissemination  

- **GitHub** encourages openness in data analysis    

- archives copied to **GitHub** can be private, but there is a strong case for making research archives public whenever possible
