# Rmarkdown to Quarto  
&lt;br&gt;
- quarto extends rmarkdown to allow code chunks in R, Python, Julia and Javascript  
&lt;br&gt;
- Developed by **Posit** as part of their move to support other languages  
&lt;br&gt;
- At present rmarkdown files can be rendered with quarto without any adaptation  
&lt;br&gt;
- In future, development efforts will be directed at quarto  

---
# Archiving Data  

&lt;br&gt;
- archive scripts and the raw data and you do not need to archive data files or results files unless compute time is a issue  

- create a local data repo with the R Packages such as `repo` and `archivist`   

- small amounts of data can be saved to GitHub (50Mb limit)  

- data repositories (see https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories) will host data for sharing, e.g. as part of a publication  

- cloud computing providers will host your data. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud etc. (all offer a free service to get you started)  

---
# Make Files

&lt;br&gt;
- for reproducibility, a project should be controlled by a make file (a master script that runs everything else).   

- the R package `makepipe` creates a master script  

- the R package `targets` creates a master script and caches intermediate results  

- for maximum efficiency, `makepipe` and `targets` monitor changes to the code and only re-run code that is affected by the changes  

---
# Package Versions

&lt;br&gt;
- packages are updated regularly, with bug fixes, new features etc.    
&lt;br&gt;
- code that works with one version of a package, may not work with another version  
&lt;br&gt;
- packages are only guaranteed to work together when their versions are in sync      
&lt;br&gt;
- code that works for you, might fail for someone else if they use a different version of a package  
&lt;br&gt;
- R sets up a single library of packages that is accessed by all of your projects  
  - updating might be good for one project and disastrous for another  
&lt;br&gt;
- `renv` allows separate libraries for every project and keeps track of the version numbers that you are using so that you can pass that information to a collaborator    


---
# Your Own Packages

&lt;br&gt;
- a personal package is a convenient way to store your functions  
&lt;br&gt;
- functions in a package can be documented with `roxygen2` to provide help on the syntax  
&lt;br&gt;
- functions in a personal package can be used across all of your projects  
&lt;br&gt;
- you can upload your package to GitHub and share it with colleagues or even the whole world    
&lt;br&gt;
- do not go public without much thought. Maintaining a package is a big undertaking  

---
# Functional programming

&lt;br&gt;
- Good Practice says that
  - modularisation of project code makes it easier to write and maintain  
  - using functions for repeated tasks makes scripts easier to write and maintain  
  - well-named functions act like comments    
&lt;br&gt;
- the `purrr` package provides ways of applying a function multiple times with different inputs, so called functional programming (FP)    
  - coding without loops  
  - it takes a while to adjust to full FP but eventually your code will be easier to follow and less likely to contain errors  
---
# Learn html and latex

&lt;br&gt;
- markdown only offers basic formatting. At some point, you will need a format that markdown does not provide  
&lt;br&gt;
- it is good to have a house-style for your documents. You could start with a markdown theme found on the internet, but eventually you will want to design your own  
&lt;br&gt;
- to have full control over an html document you need to know the html language and to control a pdf you need to know latex  

---
# Learn Shiny

&lt;br&gt;
- shiny provides interactive visualisations  
&lt;br&gt;
- shiny dashboards are excellent for 
  - exploring large datasets  
  - communicating your results  
&lt;br&gt;
- visit https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/ to see what shiny can do  

---
# Make Better Reports

&lt;br&gt;
- learn a tables package so that you can produce pretty tables  
  - `gt` and `flextable` are the best  
  - `kable` and `kableExtra` are simpler alternatives  
&lt;br&gt;
- improve your ggplot2 skills. e.g. use `patchwork`   
&lt;br&gt;
- learn how to produce maps in R  
&lt;br&gt;
- learn how to make diagrams in R, e.g. R package `diagrammeR`,
latex package **tikz**  
&lt;br&gt;
- handle BibTeX citation with an R package. see https://ropensci.org/blog/2020/05/07/rmd-citations/  
---
# Use Machine Learning Methods  
&lt;br&gt;
- any fool can run fit an ML model, very few people understand those models  
  - understand boasting, bagging, regularization etc.    
&lt;br&gt;
- Machine Learning models often out-perform statistical models  
  - try tree-based methods, such as random forests or XGBoost  
&lt;br&gt;
- learn to analyse textual and image data   
&lt;br&gt;
- learn the basics of deep learning  
  - how do you fit a neural network?  
  - why are large neural networks so good at prediction?  
  - what are the problems of a model with a billion parameters?  
  - what is the difference between a transformer and a GAN?
---
# Integrate AI into Your Workflow

&lt;br&gt;
- deep learning will dominate data science, at least in the medium term   
&lt;br&gt;
- explore ways of using ChatGPT or GPT-4 in your daily work   
  - to explain a difficult concept    
  - to review a topic  
  - to write your next grant application  
  - to write R code    
  - to add comments to existing R code  
  - to find errors in your code  
&lt;br&gt;
- consider the ethics of using AI in research.  
  - What about the ethics of not using AI?  
  - Do you need a group policy?   
 
---
# Learn a Second Language

&lt;br&gt;
- many R packages use C++ in the background to provide speed  
  - learn C/C++ and the Rcpp package  
&lt;br&gt;
- learn python if you want to get deeper into machine learning  
&lt;br&gt;
- learn Julia or another of the modern languages  
  - nearly as fast a C but without the pain  
  - some good ML and Bayesian packages
